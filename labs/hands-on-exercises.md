# Hands-On Exercises

## Exercise 1 – End-to-End Purple Simulation
- **Scenario**: Phishing email → Credential theft → Lateral movement.  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Red team sends simulated phishing payload.  
  2. Blue team monitors & responds.  
  3. Purple team documents ATT&CK mapping and detection gaps.  

## Exercise 2 – Dashboard Metrics
- Build dashboard with coverage by ATT&CK technique.  
- Present % detected vs. missed.  

## Exercise 3 – Automated Playbook
- Use SOAR platform to automate:  
  - Detect → Isolate endpoint → Notify analyst.  
- Validate with simulated malware execution.
