## 📝 Personal Review  

This course significantly strengthened my understanding of **how red and blue teams can collaborate** effectively through **purple team methodology**.  
I practiced adversary emulation, detection engineering, and joint incident response through structured labs and playbooks.  

The most valuable takeaway was the **hands-on integration of red and blue team exercises** using the **AttackIQ platform**, which helped me understand how to align detection rules, improve telemetry, and measure security effectiveness.  

By combining **adversary techniques** with **defensive controls**, I learned how to build **continuous feedback loops** that improve both offensive and defensive capabilities in real-world environments.  

Overall, this course is highly recommended for anyone seeking to bridge the gap between **offensive and defensive security operations**.
