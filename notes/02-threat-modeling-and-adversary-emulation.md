# Threat Modeling and Adversary Emulation

## Objectives
- Learn how to model threats using ATT&CK framework.  
- Understand adversary emulation plans.  

## Key Points
- Threat modeling = identify potential attacker goals.  
- Emulation ≠ penetration testing; it’s scenario-driven.  
- Use TTPs mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.  

## Lab
- Create adversary profile for a phishing → credential theft → lateral movement scenario.
